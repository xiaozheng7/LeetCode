# Leet 1. Two Sum
```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
```
Just the very basic usage of hash. Double pointer can also solve this, but it is tricky when return index (you have to sort both index and number).
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        '''hash method (best for return index instead of numbers)'''
        time and space both o(n)
        hash_dict = {}

        for i in range(0, len(nums)):
            if target - nums[i] in hash_dict:
                return [i, hash_dict[target - nums[i]]]
            else:
                hash_dict[nums[i]] = i
```



# Lint 463. Sort Integers
## quick sort
```
Given an integer array, sort it in ascending order. Use selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort or any O(n2) algorithm.
```
when to use >= or <= instead of > < is the tricky part. 
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param a: an integer array
    @return: nothing
    """
    def sort_integers(self, a: List[int]):
        # write your code here
        self.quick_sort(a, 0, len(a)-1)

    def quick_sort (self, a, start, end):
        if start >= end:
            return

        splitpoint = self.partition(a, start, end)
        self.quick_sort(a, start, splitpoint - 1)
        self.quick_sort(a, splitpoint + 1, end)

    def partition (self, a, start, end):
        pivot = a[start]
        left, right = start + 1, end

        while left <= right:
            while left <= right and a[left] <= pivot: # a[left] <= pivot cause <= means it is already at the correct side; 
                left += 1
            while left <= right and a[right] >= pivot: # why left <= right (instead of left < right)? Cause when left == right, we need to move right 1 more time to let it point at the last element that is <= than the pivot.
                right -= 1

            if left <= right: # this = seems doesn't matter
                a[left], a[right] = a[right], a[left]

        a[start], a[right] = a[right], a[start] 

        return right
```
